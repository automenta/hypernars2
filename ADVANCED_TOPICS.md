# Advanced Topics

This document covers more specialized, complex, and forward-looking aspects of the system's architecture.

## 1. Concurrency and Parallelism

The system is designed to leverage concurrency to improve performance and scalability, especially on multi-core processors. The primary concurrency model is the **Actor Model**, which maps well to the distributed, message-passing nature of the system's components.

-   **Concurrent Concept Processing**: Each `Concept` can be implemented as a lightweight actor. This allows the system to process sentences related to different concepts in parallel. For example, reasoning about "cats" and "dogs" can happen concurrently without interference.
-   **Parallel Inference**: While the primary reasoning loop is sequential, there are opportunities for parallelizing parts of the inference process. For example, the MeTTa interpreter could attempt to match a sentence against multiple beliefs or rules simultaneously.
-   **Asynchronous Grounding**: Calls to grounded atoms, especially those involving I/O (like API calls), must be executed asynchronously to prevent blocking the entire reasoning kernel.

### 1.1. Actor Lifecycle and Supervision
If an Actor Model is used, a clear lifecycle for `Concept` actors must be defined, managed by a dedicated `Supervisor`.

-   **Creation / Awakening**: Actors are created "on-demand" when a new `Atom` is encountered or awakened from a passivated state.
-   **Passivation (Suspension)**: To manage memory, actors for concepts with low activation can be passivated by serializing their state to persistent storage and shutting down.
-   **Termination**: Actors are terminated when their corresponding `Concept` is permanently forgotten.
-   **Supervision and Fault Tolerance**: The `Supervisor` is also responsible for fault tolerance. If an actor crashes, the supervisor should catch the failure and apply a recovery strategy.

## 2. Self-Governing Evolution and Self-Awareness

A long-term ambition for HyperNARS is to achieve a degree of self-governing evolution. This vision extends beyond simple runtime adaptation to encompass the system's ability to reason about and improve its own architecture and codebase. This capability is underpinned by the principle of representing knowledge and process uniformly as atoms.

The pathway to this ambitious goal involves several stages:
1.  **Architectural Self-Representation**: The system uses the `Codebase Integrity Manager` to parse its own design documents and source code, creating a model of its architecture within its own Memory.
2.  **Self-Analysis**: Using this self-model, the system can reason about its own structure and behavior to detect inconsistencies, identify performance bottlenecks, or find gaps in its knowledge.
3.  **Hypothesize Improvements**: Based on its analysis, the system can formulate hypotheses for improvement, represented as atoms.
4.  **Sandboxed Verification**: The system can spin up a sandboxed instance of itself to test the proposed changes and predict their impact.
5.  **Autonomous Deployment**: If a change is verified as beneficial and safe, the system could autonomously integrate it into its live operational code.

### 2.1. Self-Regulation and Healing
The system can be designed to monitor its own cognitive behaviors. For example, if it detects a high rate of contradictions, it can form a sentence (a belief) about this "meta-problem" and initiate a goal sentence to investigate the cause. This might lead it to revise the truth-values of the responsible beliefs or even adjust the confidence of the inference rules that produced them, creating a feedback loop for automated self-healing.

### 2.2. Bootstrapped Development and Testing
This self-reasoning capability can be leveraged as a powerful tool for the system's own development and verification.
-   **Specification Analysis**: The system can ingest its own design documents and formal test specifications as knowledge to detect inconsistencies between principle and implementation.
-   **Causal Analysis of Tests**: When a unit test fails, the system can be tasked with finding the cause by analyzing the derivation path that led to the failure.
-   **Automated Test Generation**: The system can analyze its own codebase to identify under-utilized rules or logical pathways and then autonomously generate new sentences specifically designed to trigger them, effectively creating new unit tests.

## 3. System Bootstrapping and Foundational Knowledge

The system cannot start from a completely blank state. It requires a minimal set of foundational knowledge to be "bootstrapped" at initialization. This knowledge provides the basic scaffolding for all subsequent learning and reasoning. This foundational knowledge set includes:

-   **Core Inference Schemas**: The essential MeTTa atoms that define the built-in inference rules, such as deduction, abduction, induction, revision, and choice.
-   **Core Ontology**: A minimal set of concepts and relations that structure its world model, such as atoms representing `Type`, `Inheritance`, `Property`, `Time`, and `Event`.
-   **Grounded Primitives**: A declarative understanding of the available grounded atoms (operators), including their purpose, inputs, and expected outputs.
-   **Self-Model**: A basic representation of the system itself, such as `(. (isa SELF System))`, which allows it to reason about its own properties and actions.
