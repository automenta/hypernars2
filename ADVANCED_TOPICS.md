# Advanced Topics

This document covers more specialized, complex, and forward-looking aspects of the system's architecture, building upon the foundational concepts described in the [**System Architecture**](./ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

All terminology is defined in the [**Glossary**](./DATA_STRUCTURES.md#1-glossary-of-core-terms).

## 1. Concurrency and Parallelism

The system is designed to leverage concurrency to improve performance and scalability. The primary concurrency model under consideration is the **Actor Model**, which maps well to the distributed, message-passing nature of the system's components.

-   **Concurrent Concept Processing**: Each `Concept` can be implemented as a lightweight actor, allowing the system to process sentences related to different concepts in parallel.
-   **Parallel Inference**: While the primary reasoning loop is conceptually sequential, there are opportunities for parallelizing parts of the inference process itself.
-   **Asynchronous Grounding**: Calls to `GroundedAtom`s, especially those involving I/O, must be executed asynchronously to prevent blocking the entire reasoning kernel.

### 1.1. Actor Lifecycle and Supervision
If an Actor Model is used, a clear lifecycle for `Concept` actors must be defined, managed by a dedicated `Supervisor` actor.

-   **Creation / Awakening**: Actors are created "on-demand" when a new `Atom` is encountered or awakened from a passivated state.
-   **Passivation (Suspension)**: To manage memory, actors for `Concept`s with low `Budget`s can be passivated by serializing their state and shutting down.
-   **Termination**: Actors are terminated when their corresponding `Concept` is permanently forgotten.
-   **Supervision and Fault Tolerance**: The `Supervisor` is also responsible for fault tolerance, catching actor failures and applying a recovery strategy.

## 2. Self-Governing Evolution

A long-term ambition for HyperNARS is to achieve a degree of self-governing evolution. This vision extends beyond simple runtime adaptation to encompass the system's ability to reason about and improve its own architecture and codebase. This capability is underpinned by the metaprogramming principle of representing knowledge and process uniformly as atoms.

The pathway to this ambitious goal involves several stages:
1.  **Architectural Self-Representation**: The system uses a `CognitiveFunction` to parse its own design documents and source code, creating a model of its architecture within its own Memory.
2.  **Self-Analysis**: Using this self-model, the system can reason about its own structure and behavior to detect inconsistencies or identify performance bottlenecks.
3.  **Hypothesize Improvements**: Based on its analysis, the system can formulate hypotheses for improvement, represented as `Goal` atoms.
4.  **Sandboxed Verification**: The system can spin up a sandboxed instance of itself to test the proposed changes and predict their impact.
5.  **Autonomous Deployment**: If a change is verified as beneficial and safe, the system could autonomously integrate it into its live operational code.

### 2.1. Self-Regulation and Healing
The system can be designed to monitor its own cognitive behaviors. For example, if it detects a high rate of contradictions, it can form a belief about this "meta-problem" and initiate a `Goal` to investigate the cause. This might lead it to revise the `Truth` values of the responsible beliefs or even adjust the confidence of the inference rules that produced them.

### 2.2. Bootstrapped Development and Testing
This self-reasoning capability can be leveraged as a powerful tool for the system's own development.
-   **Specification Analysis**: The system can ingest its own design documents to detect inconsistencies between principle and implementation.
-   **Causal Analysis of Tests**: When a unit test fails, the system can be tasked with finding the cause by analyzing the derivation `Stamp` that led to the failure.
-   **Automated Test Generation**: The system can analyze its own codebase to identify under-utilized rules or logical pathways and then autonomously generate new `Sentence`s specifically designed to trigger them, effectively creating new unit tests.

## 3. Foundational Knowledge

The system cannot start from a completely blank state. It requires a minimal set of foundational knowledge to be "bootstrapped" at initialization, as described in the [**API and Integration Guide**](./API_AND_INTEGRATION.md#2-system-initialization). This knowledge provides the basic scaffolding for all subsequent learning and reasoning.

This foundational knowledge set includes:
-   **Core Inference Schemas**: The essential MeTTa atoms that define the built-in inference rules (e.g., deduction, abduction, induction).
-   **Core Ontology**: A minimal set of concepts and relations that structure its world model (e.g., atoms for `Type`, `Inheritance`, `Property`, `Time`).
-   **Grounded Primitives**: A declarative understanding of the available `GroundedAtom`s, including their purpose, inputs, and outputs.
-   **Self-Model**: A basic representation of the system itself, such as `(. (isa SELF System))`, which allows it to reason about its own properties and actions.
