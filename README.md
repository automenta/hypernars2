# HyperNARS: A Specification for a Metaprogrammable AGI

## Overview

This project outlines the architecture for HyperNARS, a next-generation reasoning system that synergistically integrates the principles of the **Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS)** with the powerful, metaprogrammable framework of **OpenCog Hyperon** and its native language, **MeTTa (Meta Type Talk)**.

The goal is to specify a robust, transparent, and self-improving platform for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that is defined not by rigid code, but by the contents of its own knowledge base.

This repository contains a consolidated set of documents that serve as the primary architectural and conceptual specification for the HyperNARS system. The design has been aggressively deduplicated to provide a clear and implementable guide.

## Documentation Structure

The specification is now organized into four primary documents, designed to be read in order:

1.  [**`1_Architecture.md`**](./1_Architecture.md): The primary and most comprehensive document. It describes the complete system architecture, from core principles and memory management to reasoning, symbol grounding, safety, and advanced topics. **Start here for a deep understanding of the system.**

2.  [**`2_Data_Model.md`**](./2_Data_Model.md): The authoritative reference for all data structures and formal, machine-readable schemas. This includes the project glossary, core type definitions, and all `define-*` schemas that specify the system's cognitive functions, APIs, and configurations.

3.  [**`3_API_and_Usage.md`**](./3_API_and_Usage.md): A practical guide for developers. It begins with a conceptual walkthrough for new users and then provides a detailed reference for the public API, system initialization, and extension points.

4.  [**`4_Verification.md`**](./4_Verification.md): A set of concrete, testable scenarios that verify the system's safety and resilience requirements.
