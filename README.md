# HyperNARS: A Specification for a Metaprogrammable AGI

## Overview

This project outlines the architecture for HyperNARS, a next-generation reasoning system that synergistically integrates the principles of the **Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS)** with the powerful, metaprogrammable framework of **OpenCog Hyperon** and its native language, **MeTTa (Meta Type Talk)**.

The goal is to specify a robust, transparent, and self-improving platform for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that is defined not by rigid code, but by the contents of its own knowledge base.

This repository contains a set of documents that serve as the primary architectural and conceptual specification for the HyperNARS system.

## How to Read These Documents

This specification is detailed and interconnected. For the best understanding, we recommend the following reading path:

1.  **Start Here:** `README.md` (this file)
2.  **For a Quick Overview:** [**`TUTORIAL.md`**](./TUTORIAL.md) provides a high-level conceptual walkthrough.
3.  **For the Core Concepts:** [**`ARCHITECTURE.md`**](./ARCHITECTURE.md) is the main document describing the foundational principles, including the metaprogramming approach, the dual-process reasoning model, and the layered cognitive architecture.
4.  **For Data Schemas & Terms:** [**`DATA_STRUCTURES.md`**](./DATA_STRUCTURES.md) is the authoritative reference for all data types and contains the complete project **Glossary**.
5.  **For Deeper Detail:** The remaining documents provide detailed specifications for each component of the system.
