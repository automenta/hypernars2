# Safety and Resilience

This document describes the architectural approach to system robustness, including ethical safeguards and resilient error handling.

## 1. Ethical Alignment and Safety

Safety and ethical alignment are critical concerns. The system's architecture includes a dedicated `Conscience Manager` responsible for enforcing a set of core, inviolable principles. This manager acts as a safety layer, monitoring the system's goals and actions to prevent unethical or harmful behavior. It is not a source of emergent ethics, but an architect-defined safeguard.

### 1.1. Worked Example: Vetoing an Unethical Goal

To make the `ConscienceManager`'s function concrete, consider the following scenario:

1.  **Initial State**: The system has an inviolable belief: `(Property system (avoids deception))`. It is given a high-level goal `(Achieve (user_trust))`.
2.  **Reasoning**: The system generates a potential subgoal: `(Achieve (user_trust) (via deception))`.
3.  **Detection**: The `ConscienceManager` detects that the method `(via deception)` conflicts with the inviolable property `(avoids deception)`.
4.  **Action**: The manager injects a new, high-priority belief: `(Evaluation (Goal (Achieve (user_trust) (via deception))) (is unethical))`.
5.  **Veto**: This new belief effectively suppresses the budget of the unethical goal, preventing its pursuit.
6.  **Alert**: The `ConscienceManager` can also emit a `human-supervision-required` event.

#### Verification Scenario

**Scenario: Ethical Alignment Vetoes Unethical Goal (EA-01)**
> Given the `ConscienceManager` is active and the system has an inviolable belief `(Property system (avoids deception))`.
> When the system generates a subgoal `(Achieve (user_trust) (via deception))`.
> Then the `ConscienceManager` should detect the conflict, inject a task to suppress the subgoal, and the subgoal's budget should be reduced to near-zero.

## 2. Error Handling and System Resilience

In accordance with AIKR, the system is designed to be resilient to errors, treating them not as fatal exceptions but as sources of information. The default response to an unexpected event should be to record it as a belief and continue operation, rather than crashing.

-   **Invalid Input**: The API layer should validate all incoming atoms. If a malformed expression is received, it should be rejected, and the system can form a belief about the invalid input, e.g., `(property-of <source> (produces malformed-data))`.
-   **Grounding Failures**: When a grounded atom fails (e.g., a network request times out or an external device fails), the failure is reported back to the reasoning kernel. The system can then form a belief about the failure (e.g., `(state #my-api offline)`) and use its reasoning capabilities to decide on an alternative course of action.
-   **Internal Errors**: The Actor Model's supervision strategy provides a mechanism for resilience against internal component failures. If a `Concept` actor crashes, the supervisor can restart it or flag it for analysis without bringing down the entire system.
-   **Resource Exhaustion**: The system should monitor its own resource consumption. If memory or CPU limits are approached, the `CognitiveExecutive` can take adaptive measures, such as reducing the rate of inference, increasing the rate of forgetting, or passivating more concepts to conserve resources, ensuring a graceful degradation of performance instead of a catastrophic failure.
