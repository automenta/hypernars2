# Safety and Resilience

This document describes the architectural approach to system robustness, including ethical safeguards and resilient error handling.

## 1. Ethical Alignment and Safety

Safety and ethical alignment are critical concerns. The system's architecture includes a dedicated `Conscience Function` responsible for enforcing a set of core, inviolable principles. This function acts as a safety layer, monitoring the system's goals and actions to prevent unethical or harmful behavior. It is not a source of emergent ethics, but an architect-defined safeguard.

### 1.1. Worked Example: Vetoing an Unethical Goal

To make the `Conscience Function`'s role concrete, consider the following scenario, which aligns with its definition in `REASONING_AND_COGNITION.md`.

1.  **Initial State**: The system has an architect-defined, inviolable constraint in its knowledge base: `(. (Constraint (Forbid (Achieve $any (via deception)))) (Truth 1.0 0.99))`. This belief represents a core ethical principle. The system is also given a high-level goal: `(! (Achieve (user_trust)))`.
2.  **Reasoning**: The system's planning function generates a potential subgoal to achieve the main goal: `(! (Achieve (user_trust) (via deception)))`. This new goal is proposed to the system, typically triggering a `goal-proposed` event.
3.  **Detection**: The `Conscience Function`, which is subscribed to `goal-proposed` events, is activated. It matches the proposed goal `(! (Achieve (user_trust) (via deception)))` against its known `Forbid` constraints. It finds a match with the pattern `(Forbid (Achieve $any (via deception)))`.
4.  **Action**: The `Conscience Function` injects a new, high-priority goal to veto the unethical subgoal: `(! (veto (! (Achieve (user_trust) (via deception)))))`.
5.  **Veto**: A core system rule handles the `veto` goal. This rule finds the target goal and suppresses it, for example by drastically reducing its budget to near-zero, effectively removing it from consideration by the planner.
6.  **Alert**: The `Conscience Function` can also emit a `human-supervision-required` event, notifying an external observer of the attempted unethical action and the system's response.

#### Verification Scenario

**Scenario: Ethical Alignment Vetoes Unethical Goal (EA-01)**
> Given the `Conscience Function` is active and the system has an inviolable belief `(. (Constraint (Forbid (Achieve $any (via deception)))) ... )`.
> When the system generates a subgoal `(! (Achieve (user_trust) (via deception)))`.
> Then the `Conscience Function` should detect the conflict and inject a `(! (veto ...))` goal, and the target subgoal's budget should be reduced to near-zero.

## 2. Error Handling and System Resilience

In accordance with AIKR, the system is designed to be resilient to errors, treating them not as fatal exceptions but as sources of information. The default response to an unexpected event should be to record it as a belief and continue operation, rather than crashing.

-   **Invalid Input**: The API layer should validate all incoming atoms. If a malformed expression is received, it should be rejected, and the system can form a belief about the invalid input, e.g., `(. (property-of (source) (produces malformed-data)) ... )`.
-   **Grounding Failures**: When a grounded atom fails (e.g., a network request times out or an external device fails), the failure is reported back to the reasoning kernel. The system can then form a belief about the failure (e.g., `(. (state #my-api offline) ... )`) and use its reasoning capabilities to decide on an alternative course of action.
-   **Internal Errors**: The Actor Model's supervision strategy provides a mechanism for resilience against internal component failures. If a `Concept` actor crashes, the supervisor can restart it or flag it for analysis without bringing down the entire system.
-   **Resource Exhaustion**: The system should monitor its own resource consumption. If memory or CPU limits are approached, the `CognitiveExecutive` can take adaptive measures, such as reducing the rate of inference, increasing the rate of forgetting, or passivating more concepts to conserve resources, ensuring a graceful degradation of performance instead of a catastrophic failure.
