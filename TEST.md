This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the HyperNARS reimplementation. It serves as a blueprint for ensuring the system's correctness, robustness, and adherence to the principles of Non-Axiomatic Logic.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

The testing strategy for HyperNARS is multi-layered, designed to validate the system at different levels of granularity. This approach ensures that individual components are sound, their integrations are seamless, and the overall system behavior is correct and emergent as expected.

-   **Layer 1: Unit Tests**: At the lowest level, unit tests verify the functional correctness of individual, isolated components. These tests focus on pure functions and classes with minimal dependencies.
    -   *Examples*: `TruthValue` revision formulas, `Budget` allocation logic, individual `InferenceRule` applications.
    -   *Goal*: Ensure that the foundational building blocks of the logic are mathematically and algorithmically correct.

-   **Layer 2: Integration Tests**: These tests verify the interaction between different components of the system. They focus on the contracts and communication between modules, such as the Reasoning Kernel and the Cognitive Managers.
    -   *Examples*: A `ContradictionManager` correctly subscribing to `contradiction-detected` events from the kernel and injecting a revision task.
    -   *Goal*: Ensure that modules are wired together correctly and that their collaboration produces the expected short-term outcomes.

-   **Layer 3: End-to-End (E2E) Scenario Tests**: These are high-level tests that validate the system's reasoning capabilities on complex, multi-step problems. They treat the entire HyperNARS system as a black box, providing input and asserting on the final state of its beliefs after a number of reasoning cycles. Many of these are written in a Gherkin-style (Given/When/Then) format to be both human-readable and executable.
    -   *Examples*: Complex temporal reasoning chains, belief revision after a series of contradictory inputs, goal-directed behavior.
    -   *Goal*: Verify that the interaction of all components leads to the desired emergent, intelligent behavior and that the system can solve meaningful problems.

-   **Layer 4: Performance & Scalability Tests**: A special category of tests designed to measure the system's performance under heavy load and identify bottlenecks.
    -   *Examples*: Stress-testing the memory system with millions of concepts, measuring inference-per-second rate.
    -   *Goal*: Ensure the system meets performance requirements and remains stable and responsive at scale.

## 2. Test Categories

**Note on Test DSL:** The following scenarios use a shorthand DSL for clarity:
- `truth: "<%f,c%>"` maps to `new TruthValue(f, c)`. For example, `truth: "<%0.9,0.8%>"` creates `new TruthValue(0.9, 0.8)`.
- `priority: "#p#"` maps to the priority component of a `Budget`. For example, `priority: "#0.95#"` implies a high-priority budget.

## 3. Test Framework and Execution

To ensure consistency and ease of use, the HyperNARS test suite will be built upon a standardized, modern JavaScript testing framework.

-   **Test Runner**: **Jest** is the recommended test runner. Its features, including a built-in assertion library, mocking support, and parallel test execution, make it well-suited for this project's needs.
-   **Test Location**: All test files will be co-located with the source files they are testing, using the `*.test.js` naming convention (e.g., `MemoryManager.js` and `MemoryManager.test.js`). The E2E scenario tests, located in the `src/tests/` directory, are an exception to this, as they test the behavior of the entire system.

### Running Tests

The following `npm` scripts should be configured in `package.json` to execute different parts of the test suite:

-   `npm test`: Runs all unit and integration tests (files ending in `.test.js`). This is the primary command for developers to run during implementation.
    ```bash
    # Example command for package.json
    "test": "jest"
    ```
-   `npm run test:e2e`: Runs the high-level end-to-end scenario tests from the `src/tests/` directory. These are longer-running tests and are typically run before a new release to ensure system-level correctness.
    ```bash
    # Example command for package.json
    "test:e2e": "jest src/tests/"
    ```
-   `npm run test:coverage`: Runs all tests and generates a code coverage report, helping to identify untested parts of the codebase.
    ```bash
    # Example command for package.json
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
    ```

### How to Add a New Test

To maintain the integrity and clarity of this testing document, please follow these steps when adding a new test:

1.  **Create the Test File:** Place your new test file in the appropriate directory. Unit tests should be co-located with the source code, while new E2E scenario tests should be added to the `src/tests/` directory.
2.  **Identify the Correct Category:** Find the most relevant test category for your new test in the "Test Categories" section below.
3.  **Add a New Row:** Add a new row to the corresponding table for your test.
4.  **Fill in the Details:**
    -   **Test:** Provide the test number or a unique ID (e.g., `TUI-01`).
    -   **Status:** Set the initial status to `Proposed` or `Passing` if it's already implemented and verified.
    -   **File:** Add the filename.
    -   **Description:** Write a concise, one-sentence description of the test's objective.
    -   **Key Assertions:** Briefly describe the expected outcome or the key condition being asserted.
5.  **Update the Summary Table:** After adding your test, please update the counts in the "Test Suite Health Summary" table at the top of this document to reflect the change.

## Special Notes

### Composite Tests
- **Test 12**: Cross-concern cases (6 sub-tests)
- **Test 21**: Cross-functional tests (2 sub-tests)
